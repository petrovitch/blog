Sprinkle in the vinegar, Mixing lighty, until ingredients are well combined. From the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least one hour. Yields 12 pies.\n\nPutting it all together\n\nRemove the pastery from the refrigerator and cut it into four equal pieces. You can then cut each of the four pieces into two equal pieces, leaving you with 8 golf-ball-size dough balls. If you want minature pies make the eight pieces into 16 pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll each ball into a 5-to-6-inch circle. Or 4 inch for minatures.You can use plastic food containers to cut out pies. I find it hard to buy cutters larger than 3 inches. It\'s easy to find a glass or bowl to cut your circles.Your circles do not have to be perfect, and regged edges are okay. You can cut dough in squares with a pizza cutter or knife, fold over and finish the sane as round circles. Make any size you want. If you get to large they may be hard to handle when frying.\n\nPut 2 generous tablespoons of filling onto one side of the circle of dough.For minatures use 1 teaspoon of fruit. Seal the pie by wetting the inside edge of the dough with egg whites ( i use a pastery brush to brush on egg whites.) and then fold over the dough, making the familiar half-moon-shape pie. Make sure the edges of the dough are even, and press and crimp to insure a good seal. You can use a fork to give you a bit of a decorative edge if you like. You can also correct the more ragged edges during this step because the dough is pliable. Just make sure the filling is sealed in and any holes in the dough are crimped. When you are finished, take a fork and punch 3 times on top of the pie to let the steam excape.\n\nFrying\n\nI use two methods and both are good. To deep-fry, heat the oil in a deep pan with steep sides or a deep-fryer. Carefully lower the pies into the oil, I use Peanut Oil. You can use it to refry a lot more than any other oil without the taste transfuring to the food you are cooking. It also taste better. Drop one pie at a time, and fry until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. You don\'t have to worry about cooking the filling since it\'s already cooked. The frying process merely cooks the dough.\n\nThe second method is panfrying. Fry the pies in about a half inch of oil in an electric frying pan set to 375°F. Pan frying takes a little longer and the pies have to be turned, but the end results will be every bit as good. Sprinkle the hot pies with confectioners sugar if you like that taste. Sometime I do and sometimes I don\'t.\n\nThe Filling\nFor dried apples, \n1 ---------- pkg. Dried apples\n2 ---------- Cups sugar\n3 ---------- Tablespoons butter\nMore than cover the apples with water, they swell to about 3 time the size of the original. Cook until tender with lid partely on. You will have to keep adding water until they  are done. About 2 hours. About 10 minutes before they are done add sugar and butter. Mash until well. You can freeze what part you do not use, and use later.\n\nFor dried peaches and apricot\nUse the same cooking method as above for apples, Except they do not swell like apples. I like to add a little butter and some vanilla extract it gives it extra flavor. When done sweeted to taste. Remember all dried fruit has to be really sweet, because they are going into a crust that is not sweet.',NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

	(137,'Pastery','Pastery --- What You Should Know',NULL,'Combine ingredients for crust and chill dough for ten minutes in the refrigerator. This reduces the amount of flour needed when rolling crust. (Excess flour toughens crust.)\nToo much moisture in the dough will make the crust tough and cause the pie to steam rather than bake. Handle dough as little as possible after adding water, and use a pastry cloth and stockinet covered rolling pin when rolling the crust. Besides creating a tender, flaky crust, you will use less flour and fewer strokes.\n\nPastry may be rolled between two sheets of wax paper. Peel off the top paper and flip the bottom into the pie pan. Removeing the paper. When placing a crust in the pan, be sure it covers the surface smoothly. If air is trapped beneath the surface, it can push the crust out of shape when baking. For a two crust pie, fold the top crust over the lower crust before crimping it. This will keep the juices in the pie. \nTo prevent a soggy bottom crust, brush surface with well beaten egg white before adding the filling and cool pie on a rack after baking. When baking a pie shell, place another pie pan on top of crust to prevent \"bubbling\" of the crust. Bubbling may also be prevented by pricking crust all over with fork.\n                             Fruit Pies\nFruit pies are especially tempting during the summer months when fresh fruit is at its peak. To save time when cooking the fruit, add sugar after the cornstarch (or flour) has been added to the hot juice.\nA few pieces of large macaroni inserted though the top crust or drinking straws (cut into short pieces) place in the slits of the crust will prevent juices from running out and will allow steam to esccape. (If the juice does run over in the oven, shake salt on it. This causes it to burn to a crisp so it is easily removed.)\n                             Custard Pies\nThere are many types of custard pies ranging from pumpkin to refigerator. Custard pies may be baked and frozen or may be made ahead and frozen unbaked. A frozen 8 inch pie will bake in one hour at 400°F 400°F. When baking a custard pie that has not been frozen, bake at a high temperature for ten minutes; then finish baking at a lower temperature. This prevents a soggy crust. A layer of marshmallow placed in the bottom of a pumpkin pie before the filling makes an excellent topping because the marshmallows rise to the top. Always remove a pie from the refrigerator 20 minutes before serving to remove the chill from the crust.\n                          Crumb Crust Chart\nGraham Crackers (18) --------- 1 1/2 cups \nSugar--------------------------------- 1/4 cup\nButter -------------------------------- 1/2 cup\n\n                       Vanilla Wafer Crust\nVanilla Wafers (38) --------------- 1 1/4 cups\nButter ---------------------------------- 1/2 cup\n\n                        Ginger Snaps\nGinger Snaps (24) ----------------- 1 1/4 cups\nButter ----------------------------------- 1/3 cup\n\n                          Chocolate Wafers\nChocolate Wafers ------------------- 1 1/4 cups\nButter ------------------------------------ 1/3 cup\n\nMix ingredients well and press into a 9 inch pie plate.

Add the shortening then pour out the water.\nTo keep a pie from being soggy do not pour the filling into the pastry shell until just before baking.\nBrushing the top pie crust with milk before baking will make it brown and glossy.\nThere is a difference in pie pans. Shinny metal pans do not bake bottom crust well. Use aluminum pans with a dull finish or heat proof glass pie plates.

Roast about 45-50 minutes or until the flesh Is tender.\n     Puree: Scoop away tender pumpkin flesh from the skin. Puree it in a food processor or mash it by hand until smooth. Cooked pumpkin can have a lot of moisture. To remove it, line a colander with cheesecloth or coffee filters. Place the flesh in the colander and press on it to remove excess moisture.\n     Store: Place it in a plastic sealable freezer bag and squeeze out the air. Press the bag so it will store flat, label, date and freeze. You can keep the puree about 6 months. Thaw before using.',NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

As a general rule of thumb you can test for masa dough doneness by dropping a little dough into a bowl of water. If it floats, it is light and ready to use, if it sinks, mix some more. To test wheather the dough is too wet or too dry, make the following obseration; Ideally, it should not crack at the edges, also indicating the perfect ratio of dry ingredients to fat and water\' The dough is best made 30 to 60 minutes before preparing the tamales, and no less; the dough will absorb the moisture while it is resting, making it the right airy consistency--- not heavy. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for this time (30 to 60 minutes), or for up to 2 hours. Then put the refrigerator, if nessessary, for up to 2 days; after that,  it will ferment and turn \"sour.\"The dough is best used fresh, rather than frozen. However, it can be frozen, like tamales, in an airtight container or double bag, and kept (ideally) for no more than 1 month.

Spread masa 2 to 4 inches  and 1/8 thick over corn husks or parchment paper, 4 by 6 inches, place a tablespoon of meat mixture in the center, fold over each end, I like to put 3 tamales together, place one tamale with ends up and another on top with ends turned down. Place on top of other two. Tie a string around each end, to hold together. I think the trick is to carefully enclose the filling inside the masa dough so that it does not leak out or cook too quickly and dry out. Place in a steamer, cover, and steam for 1 hour. If you don\'t have a steamed put a collender over a pot of hot water do not let tamales touch water. Use a led that fits the collander. You can freeze these tamales.you can take them out of the freezer and steam without thawing them out. Be sure to steam when you warm them, they are better steamed than they are in a microwave. Tamales are not good cooked anyother way. Let the tamales sit for 5 minutes or so after they have cooked to let the texture and flavors set up. The steaming process  releases saltiness from the tamales, so bear in mind when seasoning the dough.',NULL,NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
